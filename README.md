[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/45b95d96-66aa-4e1d-b966-ce8fa2ed3188/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/files-ari-web-xyz/deploys)

For netlify readers: source code is located at https://files.ari-web.xyz/git

You can host your files here, put them all in
files/.../..., remember that they will be public

You could access them though https://files.ari-web.xyz/files/PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE

# Permanent hosting

The files might get removed or overwritten
if they are older than 1 moth (90 days), but
you can specify something like "PLEASE DO NOT DELETE" in the PR, file itself (prefered)
and [SAFE.md](/SAFE.md)

# Hosting rules

But...

- You cannot make index.html files
- You cannot host JavaScript that will run automatically on load unless you have a proper warning on the page
- You agree that all of your files are and will stay under [ArArv2 license](/LICENSE)
- File names cannot include `#`, `?` or any other url unsafe chars
- Any illegal material will not get hosted
- Don't overwrite other's files unless they are older than 6 months and have nothing stating that you cannot remove it (See [permanent hosting](#permanent-hosting))
- Help me remove any illegal or rules evading files because being taken down is not fun

You can host your files by just making a pull request

# Site

The files are locally stored on my machine because of github limitations,
make an issue if you want any files to be added

# Api

Just make a request to [/files.json](https://files.ari-web.xyz/files.json) to get a list of all files
